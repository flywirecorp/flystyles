## Documentation

All components in flysyles are documented in `/docs` folder. The styleguide is created with Jekyll.

### Installation

First go to `/docs` folder and install jekyll:

bundle install
```

To create the build files (in `/dist` folder) execute:

```bash
bundle exec jekyll build
```

To launch jekyll local server:

```bash
bundle exec jekyll serve
```

### Working

#### Styleguide Driven Development

Styleguide Driven Development (SDD) is a practice that encourages the separation of UX, Design & Frontend from Backend concerns. This is achieved by developing the UI separately in a styleguide.

By separating the UI and backend tasks so they donâ€™t rely on each other, it allows teams to iterate fast on prototypes and designs without having to make changes to the backend. With careful planning they should plug-and-play together nicely.

#### Creating new components

To document a new component, a new markdown file has to be added to `src/_docs/components`. This file has a [Front Matter](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/frontmatter/) where you have to specify the category and the name of the component:

```
---
title: Buttons
description:
category: components
---
```

#### Browser Sync

To help in developing workflow, a Browser Sync is provided that watch local changes and refresh the browser. That way, when we need a new component, It can be created directly in the styleguide that gets the styles from Flystyles, achieving the Styleguide Driven Development (SDD).

To run the server, execute in `/docs` folder:

```bash
npm install
npm run serve
```

#### Deploy

For the moment, the project is hosted on Netlifly [flystyles.netlify.com](http://flystyles.netlify.com/). To deploy the build files, you have to create an account in Netlifly, install `netlify-cli` and deploy:

```bash
npm install netlify-cli -g
cd docs/
netlify deploy dist
```
